# 🤖 Price Negotiator E-Commerce Chatbot using NLP

## 📌 Business Problem

In today's digital shopping landscape, customers expect not just convenience, but also personalization and flexibility—especially in pricing. Traditional e-commerce systems offer fixed prices and no room for negotiation. This reduces engagement and customer satisfaction, especially for price-conscious buyers.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this project is to build a smart chatbot that enables customers to **negotiate product prices directly on e-commerce platforms** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**. This project aims to:

- Enhance customer interaction and personalization.
- Simulate human-like price negotiation using reinforcement learning.
- Increase conversion rates for e-commerce platforms by enabling flexible pricing.

## 🧠 Key Modules

### 1. **NLP Module**
- Interprets user messages using NLP techniques.
- Extracts budget, intent, and queries from conversation.

### 2. **Price Prediction Module**
- Analyzes product pricing and predicts a range for negotiation.
- Uses historical data and machine learning models for accurate estimations.

### 3. **Negotiation Engine (Reinforcement Learning)**
- Simulates negotiation between customer and seller.
- Trained on negotiation datasets to reach optimized deals.
